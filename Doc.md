# Ransomware Detection System using Machine Learning

## 1. What is this Project?

This project is a **Ransomware Detection and Prevention System** designed to identify and stop ransomware attacks by analyzing suspicious URLs and files in real-time. Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts user data and demands payment to restore access. Early detection and prevention are critical to avoid data loss and financial damage.

This system provides users with an interface to submit URLs or files for scanning, and uses advanced machine learning and heuristic techniques to detect ransomware behaviors before they cause harm.

## 2. Tech Stack Used and Purpose of Each Module

| Technology | Purpose in Project                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **React.js** | Frontend framework to build a responsive user interface for submitting URLs/files and displaying scan results. |
| **Flask (Python)** | Backend REST API server that handles requests, processes files/URLs, runs detection algorithms, and returns results. |
| **Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)** | Used for building and running ML models that classify URLs/files as malicious or safe. |
| **Heuristic Analysis Modules** | Implement rules and signature-based detection to complement ML, detecting known ransomware patterns. |
| **Database (optional, e.g., SQLite/MySQL)** | Stores historical data, detection logs, model results, and updates for better tracking and future improvements. |

## 3. Approach Used in This Project

This project uses a **hybrid detection approach** combining:

- **Machine Learning (ML)-based detection:**  
  Extracts numerical features from URLs and files, then classifies them using trained ML models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks). This enables identifying new or obfuscated ransomware patterns.

- **Heuristic and Signature-based detection:**  
  Uses predefined rules and known ransomware signatures to detect suspicious behaviors. For example, high entropy in files, suspicious API calls, or blacklisted domains.

- **Real-time analysis:**  
  Scans inputs immediately to provide quick results and prevent ransomware execution.

This hybrid model improves detection accuracy and reduces false positives by leveraging strengths of both techniques.

## 4. Comparison with Other Techniques

| Technique                  | Description                                    | Pros                                      | Cons                                      | Comparison to Our Approach           |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** | Monitors network/host activities for known attack patterns | Well-established, real-time alerts | Can generate false positives; signature-based IDS fail on new variants | Our system focuses specifically on ransomware using ML, which can detect unknown variants better than traditional IDS |
| **Signature-Based Antivirus** | Matches files against known malware signatures | Accurate for known threats | Cannot detect new or polymorphic ransomware | Our heuristic + ML approach overcomes this by learning behavioral patterns |
| **Behavioral Analysis Tools** | Monitor system/file behaviors during execution | Effective at catching zero-day attacks | May require sandboxing, slower detection | Our approach integrates behavior heuristics but also uses fast ML classification for proactive scanning |
| **Static Code Analysis** | Examines code or file structure without execution | Safe and fast | Limited by obfuscation | Our approach uses static features plus dynamic heuristics for better coverage |

Overall, our hybrid ML + heuristic method provides balanced, effective detection, with better adaptability to new ransomware compared to traditional IDS or signature-only systems.

## 5. Attributes and Features Used for Detection

### URL-based Features:

- Length of the URL  
- Presence of special characters (e.g., '@', '%', '?')  
- Use of IP address instead of domain name  
- Domain age and registration details  
- Presence of suspicious keywords or patterns  
- Number of subdomains  
- SSL certificate validity  
- URL entropy (randomness)

### File-based Features:

- File entropy (measure of randomness, high entropy may indicate encryption)  
- Opcode frequency and sequences in executable files  
- Suspicious API/system calls (e.g., encryption functions, file deletion)  
- File size and type anomalies  
- Presence of known ransomware signatures in file metadata  
- Abnormal file behaviors detected via heuristic rules

These features are extracted and fed into ML models for classification or checked against heuristic rules to flag suspicious files or URLs.

## Additional Information for Better Understanding

- **Why ML is important:**  
  Machine learning allows the system to learn from examples and detect new ransomware variants that traditional signature-based methods may miss.

- **Challenges:**  
  - Ransomware constantly evolves with new obfuscation techniques.  
  - Balancing detection accuracy and false positives is critical.  
  - Real-time scanning must be efficient to avoid slowing down users.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Integration with endpoint protection software.  
  - Using deep learning for better feature extraction.  
  - Continuous retraining with latest ransomware data.

- **Use Case:**  
  The system can be used by individuals, educational institutes, or organizations to scan suspicious emails, downloads, or links before accessing them.

## Summary

This project builds a smart, hybrid ransomware detection tool combining machine learning and heuristic analysis. It leverages modern web technologies (React.js + Flask) to provide a user-friendly interface and effective backend processing. The system is designed to improve security by detecting new ransomware threats early and preventing damage.
